# Sudoku-Solver
This Python code captures live video feed from the webcam of your laptop, captures a Sudoku puzzle on display (for example, on your mobile device), recognizes digits through OCR (pytesseract), solves the Sudoku using backtracking, and overlays the solution on top of the live video feed in real time.
